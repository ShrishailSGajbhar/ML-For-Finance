# Modeling returns and risk for a portfolio of financial assets

## Case Study: Computing stock correlation coefficient using ARIMA and LSTM RNNs

The study is based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01560.pdf) [1], where authors have presented an approach based on ARIMA (to capture the linearity) and LSTM RNNs (to capture the non-linearity). The code is given in the [repo](https://github.com/imhgchoi/ARIMA-LSTM-hybrid-corrcoef-predict) [2].
